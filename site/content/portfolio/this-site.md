This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator that uses Go templates, yaml, and markdown (in addition to the basic html, css, and javascript) to allow for a huge amount of flexibility as far as static sites go.

This site is based on a heavily modified version of the roxo theme.
